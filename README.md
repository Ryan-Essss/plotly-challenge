# Belly Button Diversity

Built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Plotly

Use the D3 library to read in 'samples.json'.

Create a horizontal bar chart showing the Top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual.

Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

Display the sample metadata / demographic info
